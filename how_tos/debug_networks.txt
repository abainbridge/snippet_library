Can you send packets from point to point using UDP with netcat?

Client: nc -u 192.168.100.11 1234
Server: nc -u -l 192.168.100.11 1234



What does tshark show at each end?

sudo tshark -i eth1 udp port 1234



If you've got more than 1 interface, is the IP route sending packets on the correct one?
$ ip route



If you can't even see the packets netcat sends in a local tshark, try rebooting
the machine, particularly if your on Azure and you've been running DPDK.



If you're using our net lib, enable PCAP_DUMP.



If you're using DPDK, see if you can send packets with testpmd.

sudo ~/dpdk-stable-18.08.1/build/app/testpmd --vdev="net_vdev_netvsc0,iface=eth1" -- --forward-mode=txonly



If you can't send packets with testpmd, does the startup text say, "cannot
access device, is mlx4_ib loaded?" If so, do:

sudo modprobe mlx4_ib
