* Create a directory where you want the build to go.
* cd to that directory.
* cmake <src directory containing CMakeLists.txt>
  * This generates a CMakeFiles diretory to contain the cache.
* Then, in the build directory, do "cmake --build ."
  * Without the "--build ." part cmake will just create the make/ninja/visual
    studio project etc files. Adding "--build" makes it actually invoke the
    underlying build system too.

* There are two stages you can configure a cmake build: 1) at cmake time, 2)
  at ninja time. To control the cmake step you need to add options to your
  CMakeLists.txt file. eg

  option(BUILD_HCI_PARSER "Build standalone HCI parser" OFF)
  if (BUILD_HCI_PARSER)
    add_subdirectory(HCI_parser)
  endif()
