First of all, we are going to write a small python script which print "Hello
World" every 60 seconds. This is going to be our service script
(hello_world.py):

    #!/usr/bin/python
    from time import sleep

    try:
        while True:
            print "Hello World"
            sleep(60)
    except KeyboardInterrupt, e:
        logging.info("Stopping...")

Now we're going to define the service to run this script:

cd /lib/systemd/system/
sudo nano hello.service

    [Unit]
    Description=Hello World
    After=multi-user.target

    [Service]
    User=pi     # Defaults to root if not specified
    Type=simple
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/hello_world.py
    Restart=on-abort

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Here we are creating a very simple service that runs our hello_world script and
if by any means is aborted is going to be restarted automatically. You can
check more on service's options in the next wiki:

    https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd

Now that we have our service we need to activate it:

    sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/hello.service
    chmod +x /home/pi/hello_world.py
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable hello.service
    sudo systemctl start hello.service

For every change that we do on the /lib/systemd/system folder we need to
execute a daemon-reload (third line of previous code). If we want to check the
status of our service, you can execute:

    sudo systemctl status hello.service

In general:

    # Check status
    sudo systemctl status hello.service

    # Start service
    sudo systemctl start hello.service

    # Stop service
    sudo systemctl stop hello.service

    # Check service's log
    sudo journalctl -f -u hello.service
