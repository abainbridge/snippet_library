The idea is to form a patch file of all the commits that pertain to your chosen
folder, then apply that patch in the new repo. The nice thing is that you can
adjust the folder names by running a sed command on the patch file before you
apply it. In my case I used sed to replace /msrc/rkvs/ with /libs/rkvs/. The
command was:

sed -i "s_/msrc/rkvs/_/libs/rkvs/_g" patch


== Get a submodule ==

git submodule init port/mediatek/r81x
git submodule update --progress port/mediatek/r81x


== Get all submodules ==

git clone --recurse-submodules


== Beyond compare ==

After setup:
    git difftool
