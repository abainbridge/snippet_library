In OneNote, Cell-Fi->Azure->EPC Resource Groups and VMs, add a row to the
table. The point here is to tell other team members the name you want to
reserve. I guess this name is used to create the VMs.

Install bash for windows. Install Azure CLI 2.0 and git. Git pull in
/mnt/c/work/OpenEPCv7_epc700.

cd /mnt/c/work/OpenEPCv7_epc700/SCRIPTS/azure/epc

Open /mnt/c/work/OpenEPCv7_epc700/SCRIPTS/azure/epc/epc.sh
    Change RESOURCE_GROUP to a lower case version of the the name you set in OneNote.

Back in Bash...

source /mnt/c/work/NetworkController/bash/setproj.sh
az login
./epc.sh
