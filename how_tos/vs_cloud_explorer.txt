You need to install the Azure SDK for VS.


When looking at a table, you can filter for today's items by putting this in the search box:
PartitionKey eq '2016-05-11'

Or you can filter on time like this:
Timestamp gt datetime'2016-05-10T00:00:00'

Or you can combine both with 'and'.



To find the SQL table:
* You need to use the SQL Server Object Explorer, not the Cloud Server.
* If you haven't already, you need to "add" a server. Azure->Users (projectbgd). user:aztvws pass:lte......
* Expand projectbgd.database.windows.net (SQL Sever...Users)->Databases->Users->Tables.
* After a while, you should see dbo.Users. Right click and select:
 * "View Code" to edit SQL. Add field to add a column.
 * "View Data" to view the data!
