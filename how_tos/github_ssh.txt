For anyone looking to change an existing TortoiseGit installation to use PuTTY
rather than OpenSSH, simply right-click, -> TortoiseGit -> Settings -> Network,
then change 'ssh.exe' to 'tortoiseplink.exe'. From then on, doing a push/pull
should be using Pageant (and any keys you have set up in there) if you also
have that running.

Run Pageant.

Add key C:\msys64\home\Andy\.ssh\snotbags.ppk

You can check that this key is known to Github by clicking on your face,
click settings, click SSH and GPG keys.
