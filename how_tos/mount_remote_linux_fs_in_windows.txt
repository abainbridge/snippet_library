Install the latest version of WinFsp.
Install the latest version of SSHFS-Win.

Ultimately I ended up using sshfs-win manager.

In Advanced settings, I set the following custom command line params:
    gid = 65792
    uid = 65792
    allow_other
    umask = 0

The gid and uid value is a magic number that "just makes it work" and
is nothing to do with my actual gid and uid values.

Previously I'd attempted to not use the "Manager" gui and instead did:

Right click on "This PC" in Windows Explorer. Select mount network drive. Enter
a spec like this \\sshfs\REMUSER@HOST[\PATH]
